	Knicks rookie Kristaps Porzingis appeared wise beyond his 19 years at the Las Vegas Summer League.<br>For starters, Porzingis, who averaged 10.5 points and 1.8 blocks on 48.0 percent shooting, had three swats<br> guarding Jahlil Okafor, who is around 40 pounds heavier at 270, in a Knicks win over the Sixers. Porzingis <br> also demonstrated an early command of the triangle offense and showed a smiling, friendly approach with <br>the tough New York media. Porzingis, whose nickname is "Zinger" in Europe, was such a crowd favorite <br>that some fans screamed enthusiastically for him to shoot as soon as he caught the ball.Porzingis also flashed<br> an experienced hand off of the court, explaining different types of foie gras and steak tartare in an interview <br>with B/R one night at 35 Steaks + Martinis restaurant at the Hard Rock Hotel. Porzingis, who has traveled <br>throughout Europe for hoops and speaks three languages (Latvian, Spanish and English), is much more <br> seasoned than a regular teenager. He also has a step ahead for living in the States with his longtime appreciation<br> for American culture, from hip-hop music to T.G.I. Friday's, his favorite restaurant in Seville, Spain, where<br> he played professionally from 2011 to 2015."I think the only time where I was really kind of stressed was where<br> he was going to land in the draft," said one of Porzingis' two older brothers, Janis, a former European player who<br> now serves as his agent for ASM Sports. "He's ready to play in the capital of the world. At first, I wasn't that sure <br>how he would adjust with all the media, but he's a tough guy. He's so cool and calm. Once he learns the [Knicks']<br> system, he's going to be way more aggressive. Now, he's trying to fit in."While in Vegas, Porzingis spoke with B/R<br> over dinner about his transition from draft-night boos to the bright lights of Vegas and New York City; his interaction<br> with Carmelo Anthony and special meeting with Kevin Garnett; his hip-hop and pingpong interests off of the court;<br> and much more. The conversation is presented below in his words and edited for clarity and length</p>
